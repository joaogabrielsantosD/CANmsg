# CANmsg

This repository is a simplification of other existing libraries, aimed at optimizing the sending and receiving of information via **CAN-BUS** for simple usage. Inspired by the `CANmsg.h` library from `MBED-OS`, this library includes a callback upon receiving the message, as well as an operator that aids in filling the buffer to be sent. For more advanced applications, I suggest reading these other two repositories that inspired the creation of this one.
